  - Automatically updates the Balance using ``=P2+O3`` (P=Balance, O=Signed).

### 📊 Excel Project Tracker

This Excel Project Tracker is a milestone based system for monitoring project tasks. It combines binary values, formulas, and visual indicators to provide a clear view of task progress across different stages.

---

## 🔹 Structure

- Task ID & Task Name: Unique identifier and description of each task.  
- Milestone Columns (Drafted → Approved):  
  - Uses binary indicators → 1 = Completed, 0 = Not Completed.  
  - Conditional formatting replaces the numbers with:
    - ✅ (checkmark) for 1  
    - ❌ (cross mark) for 0  
- To Do %: Shows the proportion of unfinished stages.  
- Completed %: Shows the proportion of finished stages.  

---

## 🔹 Formula Logic

The Completed % is calculated by counting how many stages are marked with 1:

``=COUNTIF(C9:G9,1)/5``
`C9:G9 → The range of the five milestone columns for each task.

`COUNTIF(...,1) → Counts how many milestones are completed.

/5 → Divides by the total number of milestones (5) to return a percentage.


**Examples**:

If a task has 3 milestones completed → 3/5 = 60% and If all milestones are completed → 5/5 = 100%.

The To Do % is the inverse of Completed:

``=1 - (COUNTIF(C9:G9,1)/5)``

---

🔹 Visualization

Icon Sets:

✅ Checkmark for completed stages (1) and ❌ Cross for pending stages (0).

Data Bars:

Green bars for Completed % and Red bars for To Do %.
